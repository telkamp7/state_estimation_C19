## Data

In this project, the daily record of new hospital admissions with Covid-19 in Denmark grouped by region of residence and totals are used. The data is publicly available and were obtained from Statens Serum Institut (SSI) website^[https://covid19.ssi.dk/overvagningsdata/download-fil-med-overvaagningdata]. SSI collects the data from the National Patient Registry (NPR), which contains information about outpatient contacts from Danish public as well as private hospitals. The data from NPR has some delay. Therefore, the inventory is updated daily with real-time data from the regions. The regions provide snapshot-data twice to SSI daily at 7am and 3pm. A hospital admission related to Covid-19 is defined as an admission, where a patient is admitted within 14 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Patients that are tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during an admission is also registered as a Covid-19 related admission. Furthermore, admissions with Covid-19 are only registered for patients that are present in at least one snapshot, or if the patient have been admitted for more than 12 hours according to NPR.

In Figure \@ref(fig:admissions) the total number of new admissions to the hospital are visualized.

## Generalized linear mixed effects model

Consider a hierarchical model for Y specified by

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  Y \sim \mathrm{Pois}(\lambda) \\
  \log(\lambda)=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta}+u
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $u \sim\mathrm{N}\big(0,\Sigma(\psi)\big)$.

### glmmTMB

This section describes the R package `glmmTMB` by @glmmTMB for linear and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) using Template Model Builder (TMB). The models are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation via TMB. Random effects are assumed to be Gaussian on the scale of the linear predictor and are integrated out using Laplace approximation. Additionally, gradients are calculated using automatic differentiation.


### KFAS

This section goes into detail with the R package `KFAS` by @KFAS for state space modelling with observations from the exponential family. 


# Results

## Estimating the total number of new hospital admissions in Denmark

In Figure \@ref(fig:admittedPred) the total number of new hospitals admissions in Denmark is visualized together with the smoothed estimates from `glmmTMB` and `KFAS`.

```{r admittedPred, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Total number of new hospital admissions in Denmark with smoothed estimates from glmmTMB and KFAS."}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/GIT/state_estimation_C19/reports/figures/admitted_pred_plot.png")
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:latentState) the estimated latent intensity from `glmmTMB` and `KFAS` is visualized.

```{r latentState, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Estimated latent intensity from glmmTMB and KFAS."}

```

## Estimating the number of new hospital admissions in Denmark grouped by region

In Figure \@ref(fig:admittedRegPred) the total number of new hospitals admissions in Denmark grouped by region is visualized together with the smoothed estimates from `glmmTMB` and `KFAS`.

```{r admittedRegPred, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Total number of new hospital admissions in Denmark grouped by region with smoothed estimates from glmmTMB and KFAS."}
